Itseems like yesterday that Ianswered the phone on asnowy Januarymorning and received the news that it had been awarded the 1990 NewberyMedal. </span></p><p class="c6 c57"><span class="c0">Most books published that long ago havefaded into a pleasant, undisturbed retirement on dusty library shelves, or becomean occasionaltopicforaresearch paper. But </span><span class="c3">Number the Stars </span><span class="c0">seems to haveacquired its own long and vibrant life; nota day goes by that I don&#39;t hear froma passionatereader ofthe book&mdash;some of themparents who remember it fromtheirchildhood and are now reading it with their own children. </span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c0">I think readers ofevery age match themselvesagainst the protagonists of books they love. </span><span class="c3">Would I have donethat? </span><span class="c0">they ask themselvesas they followafictionalcharacter through a novel. </span><span class="c3">What choice would I have made? </span></p><p class="c128"><span class="c0">And ten&mdash;theage ofAnnemariein</span><span class="c3">Number the Stars,</span><span class="c0">and the approximateage ofmost ofthe book&#39;s readers&mdash;isan age when young peopleare beginning to develop astrong set of personal ethics. Theywant to be honorable people. Theywant to do theright thing. And they are beginning to realizethat the world they livein is a place wheretheright thing is often hard, sometimes dangerous,</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">and frequently unpopular. </span></p><p class="c159"><span class="c0">So they followastory abouta girltheirage,caught in a frightening situation, who mustmake decisions. Shecould takethe easyway out. Shecould turn her back on her friend. (As the readers of</span><span class="c3">Number the Stars </span><span class="c0">growolderand read other Holocaust literature, they&#39;llfind thatmany peoplein othercountries, not Denmark, did just that). Young readers rejoice whenAnnemarie takesa deep breath,enters the woods, faces the danger, stands up to theenemy,and triumphs. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">When the book was newly published, it found its way into the handsand hearts ofchildrenwho had read about but never experienced war. Now, sadly, I have heard fromyoung readers who havelosta parent oran older brother in Iraq or Afghanistan. Weall knowhoweasy it is,and howfutile, to blameand to hate. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I think the history ofDenmark has much to teach usall. </span></p><p class="c213"><span class="c0">The book has been published inmany countries now, translated into countless different languages fromHungarian to Hebrew. Everywherechildren arestillreading about theintegrity thatasmall Scandinavian population showed almostseventy yearsago. Books do changelives, I know;and many readers havetold methat </span><span class="c3">Number the Stars</span><span class="c0">changed theirs when theywere young, that it madethemthink about both cruelty and courage. &quot;It was something thatshaped my idea of howpeopleshould betreated,&quot;wrotea youngwoman recently, recalling her own fourth gradeexperience</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">with the book. </span></p><p class="c133"><span class="c0">The Danish friend who originally told methestory of her childhood inCopenhagen in 1943,and who becamethe prototype for thefictionalAnnemarie, isan old woman now. So amI. We both lovethinking ofthechildren reading thestory today,coming to it for thefirst timeand realizing that once, fora brieftimeand in a small place,a group of prejudice-free people honored the humanity of others. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c73">Lois Lowry</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c23">1. Why Are You Running? </span></p><p class="c145"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;llrace you to thecorner, Ellen!&quot;Annemarieadjusted thethick leather pack on her back so that her schoolbooks balanced evenly. &quot;Ready?&quot;Shelooked at her best friend. </span></p><p class="c129"><span class="c0">Ellenmadeaface. &quot;No,&quot;shesaid, laughing. &quot;You knowIcan&#39;t beat you -&mdash;my legsaren&#39;tas long. Can&#39;t wejust walk, likecivilized people?&quot;She wasastocky ten-year-old, unlikelankyAnnemarie. </span></p><p class="c88 c179"><span class="c0">&quot;We haveto practicefor theathletic meet on Friday&mdash;I</span><span class="c3">know </span><span class="c0">I&#39;mgoing to win the girls&#39; racethis week. I was second last week, but I&#39;ve been practicing every day. Come on, Ellen,&quot;Annemarie pleaded,eyeing the distanceto the nextcorner ofthe Copenhagen street. &quot;Please?&quot; </span></p><p class="c17 c184"><span class="c0">Ellen hesitated, then nodded and shifted her own rucksack of booksagainst her shoulders. &quot;Oh,allright. Ready,&quot;shesaid. </span></p><p class="c91"><span class="c0">&quot;Go!&quot;shouted Annemarie,and thetwo girls were off, racing along theresidentialsidewalk. Annemarie&#39;s silvery blond hair flew behind her,and Ellen&#39;s dark pigtails bounced against her shoulders. </span></p><p class="c5 c90"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait for me!&quot;wailed little Kirsti, left behind, but thetwo older girls weren&#39;t listening. </span></p><p class="c180"><span class="c0">Annemarie outdistanced her friend quickly,even though one of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her shoescame untied as shesped along thestreetcalled &Oslash;sterbrogade, past thesmallshopsand caf&eacute;s of her neighborhood herein northeast Copenhagen. Laughing, sheskirted an elderly lady in black who carried ashopping bagmade ofstring. Ayoung woman pushing a baby in acarriage moved asideto make way. The corner was justahead. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemarielooked up, panting, justas shereached thecorner. Her laughter stopped. Her heartseemed to skip a beat. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;</span><span class="c3">Halte</span><span class="c0">!&quot;thesoldier ordered in astern voice. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">The Germanword wasas familiaras it was frightening. Annemarie had heard it often enough before, but it had never been directed at her until now. </span></p><p class="c88"><span class="c0">Behind her, Ellen also slowed and stopped. Far back, little Kirsti was plodding along, her facein a pout becausethe girls hadn&#39;t waited for her. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Annemariestared up. There weretwo ofthem. Thatmeant two helmets, two sets ofcold eyes glaring at her,and four tallshiny boots planted firmly on thesidewalk, blocking her path to home. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">And itmeant two rifles, gripped in the hands ofthesoldiers. She stared at therifles first. Then, finally, shelooked into theface ofthe soldier who had ordered her to halt. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Why are you running?&quot;the harsh voiceasked. His Danishwas</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">very poor. Three years, Annemariethought with contempt. Three years they&#39;ve been in ourcountry,and stillthey can&#39;tspeak our language. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;I was racingwithmy friend,&quot;sheanswered politely. &quot;We have racesatschoolevery Friday,and I want to do well, so I&mdash;&quot;Her voicetrailed away, thesentence unfinished. Don&#39;t talk so much, she told herself. Justanswer them, that&#39;sall. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">She glanced back. Ellenwas motionless on thesidewalk,afew yards behind her. Farther back, Kirstiwas stillsulking,and walking slowly toward thecorner. Nearby,a woman had cometo the doorway ofashop and was standing silently, watching. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c0">One ofthesoldiers, thetaller one, moved toward her. Annemarierecognized himas the onesheand Ellen alwayscalled, inwhispers, &quot;the Giraffe&quot;because of his heightand thelong neck thatextended fromhis stiffcollar. Heand his partner werealways on thiscorner. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">He prodded thecorner of her backpack with thestock of his rifle. Annemarietrembled. &quot;What is in here?&quot;heasked loudly. Fromthecorner of hereye, shesawtheshopkeeper move quietly back into theshadows ofthe doorway, out ofsight. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Schoolbooks,&quot;sheanswered truthfully. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you a good student?&quot;thesoldierasked. Heseemed to be</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">sneering. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes.&quot; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;What is your name?&quot; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;AnnemarieJohansen.&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;Your friend&mdash;is shea good student, too?&quot;lie was looking beyond her,at Ellen, who hadn&#39;tmoved. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemarielooked back, too,and sawthat Ellen&#39;s face, usually rosy-cheeked, was pale,and her dark eyes were wide. </span></p><p class="c160"><span class="c0">She nodded at thesoldier. &quot;Better thanme,&quot;shesaid. &quot;What is her name?&quot; </span></p><p class="c81"><span class="c0">&quot;Ellen.&quot; </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">&quot;And who is this?&quot;heasked, looking to Annemarie&#39;s side. Kirsti had appeared theresuddenly, scowling ateveryone. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;My littlesister.&quot;Shereached down for Kirsti&#39;s hand, hut Kirsti, always stubborn, refused itand put her hands on her hips defiantly. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">Thesoldier reached down and stroked her littlesister&#39;s short, tangled curls. Stand still, Kirsti, Annemarie ordered silently, praying thatsomehowthe obstinatefive-year-old would receivethe</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">message. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">But Kirstireached up and pushed thesoldier&#39;s hand away. &quot;</span><span class="c3">Don&#39;t</span><span class="c0">,&quot;shesaid loudly. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Both soldiers began to laugh. They spoketo each other in rapid German that Annemariecouldn&#39;t understand. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Sheis pretty, like my own little girl,&quot;thetall onesaid in a more pleasant voice. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Annemarietried to smile politely. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;Go home,all of you. Go study your schoolbooks. And don&#39;t run. You look like hoodlums when you run.&quot; </span></p><p class="c153"><span class="c0">Thetwo soldiers turned away. QuicklyAnnemariereached down again and grabbed her sister&#39;s hand before Kirsticould resist. Hurrying thelittle girlalong, sherounded thecorner. In a moment Ellenwas beside her. Theywalked quickly, notspeaking, with Kirsti between them, toward thelargeapartment buildingwhere both families lived. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">When theywerealmost home, Ellenwhispered suddenly, &quot;I was so scared.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Metoo,&quot;Annemarie whispered back. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As they turned to enter their building, both girls looked straight</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ahead, toward the door. They did it purposely so that theywould notcatch theeyes or theattention oftwo moresoldiers, who stood with their guns on thiscorneras well. Kirstiscurried ahead ofthem through the door,chattering about the pictureshe was bringing homefromkindergarten to showMama. For Kirsti, thesoldiers weresimply part ofthelandscape, something that had always been there, on every corner,as unimportantas lampposts, throughout her remembered life. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you going to tell your mother?&quot;Ellen asked Annemarieas they trudged together up thestairs. &quot;I&#39;mnot. Mymother would be upset.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;No, I won&#39;t,either. Mama would probably scold mefor runningon thestreet.&quot; </span></p><p class="c112"><span class="c0">Shesaid goodbyeto Ellen on thesecond floor, where Ellen lived,and continued on to thethird, practicing in her mind acheerful greeting for her mother:asmile,a description oftoday&#39;s spelling test, inwhich she had done well. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Butshe was too late. Kirsti had gotten therefirst. </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">&quot;And he poked Annemarie&#39;s book bagwith his gun,and then he grabbed my hair!&quot;Kirstiwaschattering as shetook off her sweater in thecenter oftheapartment living room. &quot;But I wasn&#39;tscared. Annemarie was,and Ellen, too. But notme!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mrs. Johansen rose quickly fromthechair by the windowwhere she&#39;d been sitting. Mrs. Rosen, Ellen&#39;s mother, was there, too, in the oppositechair. They&#39;d been having coffeetogether,as they did many afternoons. Ofcourseit wasn&#39;t really coffee, though the mothers stillcalled it that:&quot;having coffee.&quot;There had been no real coffeeinCopenhagen sincethe beginning ofthe Nazi occupation. Noteven any realtea. The mothers sipped at hot water flavored with herbs. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Annemarie, what happened? What is Kirstitalking about?&quot;her motherasked anxiously. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Where&#39;s Ellen?&quot;Mrs. Rosen had afrightened look. </span></p><p class="c76"><span class="c0">&quot;Ellen&#39;s in yourapartment. She didn&#39;t realize youwere here,&quot; Annemarieexplained. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. It wasn&#39;tanything. It was the two soldiers who stand on thecorner of&Oslash;sterbrogade&mdash;you&#39;ve seen them; you knowthetall one with thelong neck, the one who looks likeasilly giraffe?&quot;Shetold her motherand Mrs. Rosen of theincident, trying to makeitsound humorousand unimportant. But their uneasy looks didn&#39;tchange. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;I slapped his hand and shouted at him,&quot;Kirstiannounced importantly. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;No, she didn&#39;t, Mama,&quot;Annemariereassured her mother. &quot;She&#39;sexaggerating,as shealways does.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mrs. Johansenmoved to the windowand looked down to the street below. The Copenhagen neighborhood was quiet; it looked thesameasalways: peoplecoming and going fromtheshops, children at play, thesoldiers on thecorner. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Shespokein alowvoiceto Ellen&#39;s mother. &quot;Theymust beedgy because ofthelatest Resistanceincidents. Did you read in</span><span class="c3">De Frie Danske</span><span class="c0">about the bombings inHiller&oslash;d and N&oslash;rrebro?&quot; </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c0">Although she pretended to beabsorbed in unpacking her schoolbooks, Annemarielistened,and she knewwhat her mother was referring to. </span><span class="c3">De Frie Danske&mdash;The Free Danes </span><span class="c0">&mdash;wasan illegal newspaper; Peter Neilsen brought it to themoccasionally, carefully folded and hidden among ordinary booksand papers,and Mamaalways burned itafter sheand Papa had read it. But Annemarie heard Mamaand Papatalk, sometimesat night,about the news they received that way: news ofsabotageagainst the Nazis, bombs hidden and exploded in thefactories that produced war materials,and industrialrailroad lines damaged so that the goodscouldn&#39;t betransported. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">And she knewwhat Resistance meant. Papa had explained, when she overheard the word and asked. The Resistancefighters were Danish people&mdash;no one knewwho, becausetheywere very secret&mdash;who were determined to bring harmto the Nazis however </span></p><p class="c198"><span class="c0">they could. They damaged the German trucksand cars,and bombed their factories. Theywere very brave. Sometimes they werecaughtand killed.</span></p><p class="c1 c191"><span class="c0">&quot;I must go and speak to Ellen,&quot;Mrs. Rosen said, moving toward the door. &quot;You girls walk a different way to schooltomorrow. Promise me, Annemarie. And Ellenwill promise, too.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c126"><span class="c0">&quot;We will, Mrs. Rosen, but what does itmatter? Thereare German soldiers on every corner.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c195"><span class="c0">&quot;Theywillremember your faces,&quot;Mrs. Rosen said, turning in the doorway to the hall. &quot;It is important to be one ofthecrowd,always.

Hesaid I was pretty.&quot; </span></p><p class="c88 c116"><span class="c0">&quot;If he has such a pretty little girl, why doesn&#39;t he go back to her likea good father?&quot;Mrs. Johansenmurmured, strokingKirsti&#39;s cheek. &quot;Why doesn&#39;t he go back to his own country?&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c154"><span class="c0">&quot;Mama, is thereanything to eat?&quot;Annemarieasked, hoping to take her mother&#39;s mind away fromthesoldiers. </span></p><p class="c194"><span class="c0">&quot;Takesome bread. And givea pieceto your sister.&quot; &quot;With butter?&quot;Kirstiasked hopefully. </span></p><p class="c150"><span class="c0">&quot;No butter,&quot;her mother replied. &quot;You knowthat.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c192"><span class="c0">Kirstisighed as Annemarie went to the breadbox in the kitchen. &quot;I wish Icould haveacupcake,&quot;shesaid. &quot;Abig yellowcupcake, with pink frosting.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c52"><span class="c0">Her mother laughed. &quot;Foralittle girl, you havealongmemory,&quot; shetold Kirsti. &quot;There hasn&#39;t been any butter, or sugar for cupcakes, foralong time. Ayear,at least.&quot; </span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">&quot;Whenwillthere becupcakesagain?&quot; </span></p><p class="c35 c47"><span class="c0">&quot;When the warends,&quot;Mrs. Johansen said. She glanced through the window, down to thestreetcorner wherethesoldiers stood, their faces impassive beneath the metal helmets. &quot;When thesoldiers leave.&quot;</span></p><p class="c158"><span class="c23">2. Who Is the Man Who Rides Past? </span></p><p class="c62"><span class="c0">&quot;Tellmeastory, Annemarie,&quot;begged Kirstias shesnuggled beside her sister in the big bed they shared. &quot;Tellmeafairy tale.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemariesmiled and wrapped herarmsaround her littlesister in the dark. AilDanish children grewup familiar with fairy tales. Hans ChristianAndersen, the most famous ofthetaletellers, had beenDanish himself. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Do youwant the oneabout thelittle mermaid?&quot;That one had always beenAnnemarie&#39;s own favorite. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">But Kirstisaid no. &quot;Tell onethatstarts with a king and a queen. And they havea beautiful daughter.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;Allright. Once upon atimethere wasa king,&quot;Annemarie began. </span></p><p class="c93"><span class="c0">&quot;And a queen,&quot;whispered Kirsti. &quot;Don&#39;t forget the queen.&quot; &quot;And a queen. They lived together in a wonderful palace,and&mdash;&quot;&quot;Was the palace named Amalienborg?&quot;Kirstiasked sleepily. &quot;Shhh. Don&#39;t keep interrupting or I&#39;ll never finish thestory. No, it</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">wasn&#39;t Amalienborg. It wasa pretend palace.&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Annemarietalked on, making up astory ofa king and queen andtheir beautiful daughter, Princess Kirsten;shesprinkled her tale with formal balls, fabulous gold-trimmed gowns,and feasts of pink frosted cupcakes, untilKirsti&#39;s deep,even breathing told her that her sister was sound asleep. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Shestopped, waited fora moment, halfexpectingKirstito murmur&quot;Thenwhat happened?&quot;But Kirstiwas still. Annemarie&#39;s thoughts turned to thereal king, ChristianX,and thereal palace, Amalienborg, where helived, in thecenter ofCopenhagen. </span></p><p class="c88"><span class="c0">Howthe people ofDenmark loved KingChristian! He was not likefairy tale kings, who seemed to stand on balconies giving orders to subjects, or who sat on golden thrones demanding to be entertained and looking for suitable husbands for their daughters. KingChristianwasareal human being,a manwith aserious, kind face. She had seen himoften, when she was younger. Each morning, he had comefromthe palace on his horse, Jubilee,and ridden alonethrough thestreets ofCopenhagen, greeting his people. Sometimes, whenAnnemarie wasalittle girl, her older sister, Lise, had taken her to stand on thesidewalk so thatshecould waveto KingChristian. Sometimes he had waved back to thetwo ofthem, and smiled. &quot;Nowyou arespecialforever,&quot;Lise had told her once, &quot;because you have been greeted by a king.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Annemarieturned her head on the pillowand stared through the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">partly opened curtains ofthe windowinto the dimSeptember night. Thinking ofLise, her solemn, lovely sister,always made her sad. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">So sheturned her thoughtsagain to the king, who was stillalive, as Lise was not. Sheremembered astory that Papa had told her, shortly after the war began, shortly after Denmark had surrendered and thesoldiers had moved in overnight to taketheir places on the corners. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Oneevening, Papa had told her thatearlier he was on an errand near his office, standing on thecorner waiting to cross thestreet, whenKingChristian came by on his morning ride. One ofthe German soldiers had turned, suddenly,and asked a question ofa teenage boy nearby. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Who is thatmanwho rides past hereeverymorning on his horse?&quot;the German soldier had asked. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Papasaid he had smiled to himself,amused that the German soldier did not know. Helistened whilethe boy answered. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;Heis our king,&quot;the boy told thesoldier. &quot;Heis the King of Denmark.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Whereis his bodyguard?&quot;thesoldier had asked. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&quot;And do you knowwhat the boy said?&quot;Papa had asked Annemarie. She was sitting on his lap. She was little, then, only seven years old. Sheshook her head, waiting to hear theanswer.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">&quot;The boy looked rightat thesoldier,and hesaid, &#39;All of Denmark is his bodyguard.&#39;&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c119"><span class="c0">Annemarie had shivered. Itsounded likea very braveanswer. &quot;Is it true, Papa?&quot;sheasked. &quot;What the boy said?&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c55"><span class="c0">Papathought fora moment. Healwaysconsidered questions very carefully before heanswered them. &quot;Yes,&quot;hesaid at last. &quot;It is true. AnyDanish citizenwould diefor KingChristian, to protect him.&quot; </span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">&quot;You too, Papa?&quot; </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes.&quot; </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c0">&quot;And Mama?&quot; </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c0">&quot;Mamatoo.&quot; </span></p><p class="c142"><span class="c0">Annemarieshivered again. &quot;Then I would too, Papa. IfI had to.&quot; </span></p><p class="c117"><span class="c0">They satsilently fora moment. Fromacross theroom, Mama watched them, Annemarieand Papa,and shesmiled. Mama had been crocheting thatevening three yearsago:thelacy edging ofa pillowcase, part ofUse&#39;s trousseau. Her fingers moved rapidly, </span></p><p class="c189"><span class="c0">turning thethinwhitethread into an intricate narrowborder. Lise wasa grownup girl ofeighteen, then,about to be married to Peter Neilsen. WhenLiseand Peter married, Mamasaid, Annemarieand</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Kirstiwould havea brother for the very first time. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;Papa,&quot;Annemarie had said, finally, into thesilence, &quot;sometimes I wonder why the kingwasn&#39;tableto protect us. Why didn&#39;t hefight the Nazis so that theywouldn&#39;tcomeinto Denmark with their guns?&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Papasighed. &quot;Wearesuch atiny country,&quot;hesaid. &quot;And they aresuch an enormousenemy. Our kingwas wise. He knewhow fewsoldiers Denmark had. He knewthatmany, manyDanish people would dieifwefought.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;InNorway they fought,&quot;Annemarie pointed out. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Papa nodded. &quot;They fought very fiercely inNorway. They had those huge mountains for the Nor wegian soldiers to hidein. Even so, Norwaywascrushed.&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">In her mind, Annemarie had pictured Norway as she remembered it fromthe map atschool, up above Denmark. Norwaywas pink on theschoolmap. Sheimagined the pink strip of Norway crushed by afist. </span></p><p class="c169"><span class="c0">&quot;Arethere German soldiers inNorway now, thesameas here?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot;Papasaid. </span></p><p class="c105"><span class="c0">&quot;InHolland, too,&quot;Mamaadded fromacross theroom, &quot;and Belgiumand France.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c99"><span class="c0">&quot;But not in Sweden!&quot;Annemarieannounced, proud thatshe knewso much about the world. Swedenwas blue on the map,and she had </span><span class="c3">seen </span><span class="c0">Sweden,even though she had never been there. Standing behind Uncle Henrik&#39;s house, north ofCopenhagen, she had looked across the water&mdash;the part ofthe North Seathat was called the Kattegat&mdash;to theland on the other side. &quot;That is Sweden you areseeing,&quot;Uncle Henrik had told her. &quot;You arelooking across to anothercountry.&quot; </span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot;Papa had said. &quot;Sweden is stillfree.&quot; </span></p><p class="c205"><span class="c0">And now, three years later, it was </span><span class="c3">still </span><span class="c0">true. Butmuch else had changed. KingChristianwas getting old,and he had been badly injured last year in afallfromhis horse, faithful old Jubilee, who had carried himaround Copenhagen so manymornings. For days they thought he would die,and all ofDenmark had mourned. </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c0">But he hadn&#39;t. KingChristianXwas stillalive. </span></p><p class="c206"><span class="c0">It was Lise who was not. It was her tall, beautifulsister who had died in an accident two weeks before her wedding. In the blue carved trunk in thecorner ofthis bedroom&mdash;Annemariecould see its shapeeven in the dark&mdash;werefolded Lise&#39;s pillowcases with theircrocheted edges, her wedding dress with its hand embroidered neckline, unworn,and the ellowdress thatshe had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">worn and danced in, with its fullskirt flying,at the party celebrating herengagement to Peter. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Mamaand Papa never spoke ofLise. They never opened the trunk. But Annemarie did, fromtimeto time, when she wasalonein theapartment;alone, shetouched Lise&#39;s things gently, remembering </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c0">her quiet, soft-spoken sister who had looked forward so to marriageand children of her own. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Redheaded Peter, her sister&#39;s fiance, had notmarried anyonein the years since Lise&#39;s death. He had changed a great deal. Once he had been likeafun-loving older brother to Annemarieand Kirsti, teasing and tickling,alwaysasource offoolishnessand pranks. Nowhestillstopped by theapartment often,and his greetings to the girls were warmand smiling, but he was usually in a hurry, talking quickly to Mamaand Papaabout things Annemarie didn&#39;t understand. He no longer sang the nonsensesongs that had once made Annemarieand Kirstishriek with laughter. And he never lingered anymore. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Papa had changed, too. Heseemed much olderand very tired, defeated. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The whole world had changed. Only thefairy tales remained the same. </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">&quot;And they lived happily everafter,&quot;Annemarierecited, whispering into the dark,completing thetalefor her sister, who</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">slept beside her, onethumb in her mouth.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c23">3. Where Is Mrs. Hirsch? </span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c0">The days ofSeptember passed, oneafter the other, much the same. Annemarieand Ellenwalked to schooltogether,and home again,always nowtaking thelonger way,avoiding thetallsoldier and his partner. Kirsti dawdled just behind themor scampered </span></p><p class="c49"><span class="c0">ahead, never out oftheir sight. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Thetwo mothers still had their&quot;coffee&quot;together in the afternoons. They began to knitmittensas the days grewslightly shorterand thefirst leaves began to fallfromthetrees, because another winter wascoming. Everyoneremembered thelast one. There was no fuel nowfor the homesand apartments in Copenhagen,and the winter nights wereterribly cold. </span></p><p class="c153"><span class="c0">Likethe other families in their building, theJohansens had opened the old chimney and installed alittlestoveto usefor heat when they could find coalto burn. Mama used it too, sometimes, forcooking, becauseelectricitywas rationed now. At night they </span></p><p class="c85"><span class="c0">used candles for light. Sometimes Ellen&#39;s father,ateacher, complained in frustration because hecouldn&#39;tseein the dimlight to correct his students&#39; papers. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;Soonwe will haveto add another blanket to your bed,&quot;Mama said one morning as sheand Annemarietidied the bedroom. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Kirstiand Iareluck to haveeach other for warmth in the</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">winter,&quot;Annemariesaid. &quot;Poor Ellen, to have no sisters.&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;She will haveto snuggleinwith her mamaand papa when it getscold,&quot;Mamasaid, smiling. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;I remember whenKirstislept between you and Papa. She was supposed to stay in hercrib, but in the middle ofthe nightshe wouldclimb outand get inwith you,&quot;Annemariesaid, smoothing the pillows on the bed. Then she hesitated and glanced at her mother, fearfulthatshe had said the wrong thing, thething that would bring the pained look to her mother&#39;s face. The days when little Kirsti slept inMamaand Papa&#39;s roomwerethe days whenLiseand Annemarieshared this bed. </span></p><p class="c53"><span class="c0">But Mama was laughing quietly. &quot;I remember, too,&quot;shesaid. &quot;Sometimes she wet the bed in the middle ofthe night!&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&quot;I did not!&quot;Kirstisaid haughtily fromthe bedroomdoorway. &quot;I never,</span><span class="c3">ever </span><span class="c0">did that!&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">Mama, stilllaughing, kneltand kissed Kirsti on thecheek. &quot;Time to leavefor school, girls,&quot;shesaid. She began to buttonKirsti&#39;s jacket. &quot;Oh, dear,&quot;shesaid, suddenly. &quot;Look. This button has broken right in half. Annemarie, take Kirstiwith you,after school, to thelittleshop where Mrs. Hirsch sells thread and buttons. Seeif you can buy just one, to match the others on her jacket. I&#39;ll give you some kroner&mdash;itshouldn&#39;tcost verymuch.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Butafter school, when the girls stopped at theshop, which had been thereas long as Annemariecould remember, they found it closed. There wasa newpadlock on the door,and asign. But the signwas inGerman. They couldn&#39;t read the words. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;I wonder ifMrs. Hirsch is sick,&quot;Annemariesaid as theywalkedaway. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;I sawher Saturday,&quot;Ellen said. &quot;She was with her husband and their son. They alllooked just fine. Orat least the </span><span class="c3">parents </span><span class="c0">looked just fine&mdash;theson </span><span class="c3">always </span><span class="c0">looks likea horror.&quot;She giggled. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c0">Annemarie madeaface. The Hirsch family lived in the neighborhood, so they had seen the boy, Samuel, often. He wasa tallteenager with thick glasses, stooped shoulders,and unruly hair. Herodea bicycleto school, leaning forward and squinting, wrinkling his noseto nudge his glasses into place. His bicycle had woodenwheels, nowthat rubber tires weren&#39;tavailable,and it creaked and clattered on thestreet. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;I think the Hirschesallwent on a vacation to theseashore,&quot; Kirstiannounced. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;And I supposethey took a big basket of pink-frosted cupcakes with them,&quot;Annemariesaid sarcastically to her sister. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I supposethey did,&quot;Kirstireplied. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Annemarieand Ellen exchanged looks thatmeant:Kirstiis so</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">dumb. </span><span class="c0">No oneinCopenhagen had taken a vacation at theseashore sincethe war began. There </span><span class="c3">were </span><span class="c0">no pink-frosted cupcakes; there hadn&#39;t been for months. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Still, Annemariethought, looking back at theshop beforethey turned thecorner, where was Mrs. Hirsch? The Hirsch family had gone</span><span class="c3">somewhere. </span><span class="c0">Why else would they closetheshop? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Mama was troubled when she heard the news. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; sheasked severaltimes. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Wecan find another button someplace,&quot;Annemariereassured her. &quot;Or wecan take onefromthe bottomofthejacketand moveit up. It won&#39;tshowverymuch.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">But it didn&#39;tseemto bethejacket that worried Mama. &quot;Are you surethesignwas inGerman?&quot;sheasked. &quot;Maybe you didn&#39;t look carefully.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Mama, it had aswastika on it.&quot; </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">Her mother turned awaywith a distracted look. &quot;Annemarie, watch your sister forafewmoments. And begin to peelthe potatoes for dinner. I&#39;ll beright back.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;Whereare you going?&quot;Annemarieasked as her mother started for the door. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I want to talk to Mrs. Rosen.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c0">Puzzled, Annemarie watched her mother leavetheapartment. She went to the kitchen and opened the door to thecupboard wherethe potatoes were kept. Every night, now, itseemed, they had potatoes for dinner. And very littleelse. </span></p><p class="c107"><span class="c0">Annemarie wasalmostasleep when there wasalight knock on the bedroomdoor. Candlelightappeared as the door opened,and her mother stepped in. </span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you asleep, Annemarie?&quot; </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c0">&quot;No. Why?Is somethingwrong?&quot; </span></p><p class="c35 c127"><span class="c0">&quot;Nothing&#39;s wrong. But I&#39;d like you to get up and come out to the living room. Peter&#39;s here. Papaand I want to talk to you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c94"><span class="c0">Annemariejumped out of bed,and Kirsti grunted in her sleep. Peter! She hadn&#39;tseen himin along time. There was something frightening about his being hereat night. Copenhagen had acurfew, and no citizens wereallowed outaftereight o&#39;clock. It was very dangerous, she knew, for Peter to visitat this time. Butshe was delighted that he was here. Though his visits werealways hurried&mdash;they almostseemed secret, somehow, in a way shecouldn&#39;t quite put her finger on&mdash;still, it wasatreat to see Peter. It brought back memories of happier times. And her parents loved Peter, too. They</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">said he was likeason. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Barefoot, sheran to theliving roomand into Peter&#39;sarms. He grinned, kissed hercheek,and ruffled her long hair. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;ve grown taller sinceI sawyou last,&quot;hetold her. &quot;You&#39;re alllegs!&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemarielaughed. &quot;I won the girls&#39; footracelast Friday at school,&quot;shetold himproudly. &quot;Where have you been? We&#39;ve missed you!&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Mywork takes meall over,&quot;Peterexplained. &quot;Look, I brought you something. Onefor Kirsti, too.&quot;Hereached into his pocketand handed her two seashells. </span></p><p class="c89"><span class="c0">Annemarie put thesmaller one on thetableto saveit for her sister. She held the other in her hands, turning it in thelight, looking at theridged, pearly surface. It was so like Peter, to bring just the right gift. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;For your mamaand papa, I broughtsomethingmore practical. Two bottles of beer!&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Mamaand Papasmiled and raised their glasses. Papatook asip and wiped thefoamfromhis upper lip. Then his face became more serious. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Annemarie,&quot;hesaid, &quot;Peter tells us that the Germans have</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">issued ordersclosingmany stores run by Jews.&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;Jews?&quot;Annemarierepeated, &quot;Is Mrs. Hirsch Jewish?Is that why the button shop isclosed? Why havethey donethat?&quot; </span></p><p class="c92"><span class="c0">Peter leaned forward. &quot;It is their way oftormenting. Tor some reason, theywant to tormentJewish people. It has happened in the othercountries. They havetaken their time here&mdash;havelet us relax a little. But nowitseems to bestarting.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;But why the button shop? What harmisa button shop? Mrs. Hirsch is such a nicelady. Even Samuel&mdash;he&#39;sa dope, but he wouldnever harmanyone. Howcould he&mdash;hecan&#39;teven see, with his thick glasses!&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">ThenAnnemariethought ofsomething else. &quot;Ifthey can&#39;tsell their buttons, howwillthey earn aliving?&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&quot;Friends willtakecare ofthem,&quot;Mamasaid gently. &quot;That&#39;s what friends do.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Annemarie nodded. Mama was right, ofcourse. Friendsand neighbors would go to the home ofthe Hirsch family, would take themfish and potatoesand bread and herbs for making tea. Maybe Peter would even takethema beer. Theywould becomfortable untiltheir shop wasallowed to open again. </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">Then, suddenly, shesat upright, hereyes wide. &quot;Mama!&quot;she said. &quot;Papa! The RosensareJewish, too!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c215"><span class="c0">Her parents nodded, their faces seriousand drawn. &quot;I talked to SophyRosen thisafternoon,after you told meabout the button shop,&quot;Mamasaid. &quot;She knows what is happening. Butshe doesn&#39;t think that it willaffect them.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c220"><span class="c0">Annemariethought,and understood. Sherelaxed. &quot;Mr. Rosen doesn&#39;t haveashop. He&#39;sateacher. They can&#39;tclosea whole school!&quot;Shelooked at Peter with the question in hereyes. &quot;Can they?&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c154"><span class="c0">&quot;I think the Rosens will beallright,&quot;hesaid. &quot;But you keep an eye on your friend Ellen. And stay away fromthesoldiers. Your mother told meabout what happened on&Oslash;sterbrogade.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c132"><span class="c0">Annemarieshrugged. She had almost forgotten theincident. &quot;It was nothing. Theywere only bored and looking for someoneto talk to, I think.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c64"><span class="c0">Sheturned to her father. &quot;Papa, do you remember what you heard the boy say to thesoldier? Thatall ofDenmark would bethe king&#39;s bodyguard?&quot; </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c0">Her father smiled. &quot;I have never forgotten it,&quot;hesaid. </span></p><p class="c26 c141"><span class="c0">&quot;Well,&quot;Annemariesaid slowly, &quot;nowI think thatall ofDenmark must be bodyguard for theJews,as well.&quot; </span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">&quot;So weshall be,&quot;Papareplied.</span></p><p class="c1 c161"><span class="c0">Peter stood. &quot;I must go,&quot;hesaid. &quot;And you, Longlegs, it is way past your bedtime now.&quot;He hugged Annemarieagain. </span></p><p class="c6 c60"><span class="c0">Later, once morein her bed besidethe warmcocoon of her sister, Annemarieremembered howher father had said, three years before, that he would dieto protect the king. That her mother would, too. And Annemarie, seven years old, had announced proudly thatshealso would. </span></p><p class="c6 c170"><span class="c0">Nowshe was ten, with long legsand no moresilly dreams of pink-frosted cupcakes. And nowshe&mdash;and allthe Danes&mdash;wereto be bodyguard for Ellen,and Ellen&#39;s parents,and all ofDenmark&#39;s Jews. </span></p><p class="c6 c162"><span class="c0">Would she dieto protect them? </span><span class="c3">Truly? </span><span class="c0">Annemarie was honest enough to admit, therein the darkness, to herself, thatshe wasn&#39;t sure. </span></p><p class="c5 c214"><span class="c0">Fora momentshefelt frightened. Butshe pulled the blanket up higheraround her neck and relaxed. It wasallimaginary,anyway&mdash;not real. It was only in thefairy tales that people werecalled upon to beso brave, to diefor oneanother. Not in real-life Denmark. Oh, there werethesoldiers; that was true. And thecourageous Resistanceleaders, who sometimes lost their lives; that was true, too. </span></p><p class="c77"><span class="c0">But ordinary peoplelikethe Rosensand theJohansens?

It Will Be a Long Night </span></p><p class="c113"><span class="c0">Alonein theapartment while Mama was outshoppingwith Kirsti, Annemarieand Ellenweresprawled on theliving roomfloor playingwith paper dolls. They had cut the dolls fromMama&#39;s magazines, old ones she had saved frompast years. The paper ladies had old-fashioned hair stylesand clothes,and the girls had given themnames fromMama&#39;s very favorite book. Mama had told Annemarieand Ellen theentirestory of</span><span class="c3">Gone With the Wind,</span><span class="c0">and the girls thought itmuchmoreinteresting and romanticthan the king and-queen tales thaiKirstiloved. </span></p><p class="c6 c201"><span class="c0">&quot;Come, Melanie,&quot;Annemariesaid, walking her dollacross the edge oftherug. &quot;Let&#39;s dress for the ball.&quot; </span></p><p class="c153 c211"><span class="c0">&quot;Allright, Scarlett, I&#39;mcoming,&quot;Ellen replied in asophisticated voice. She wasatalented performer;she often played theleading roles in school dramatics. Games oftheimaginationwerealways funwhenEllen played. </span></p><p class="c138"><span class="c0">The door opened and Kirstistomped in, her facetear-stained and glowering. Mamafollowed her with an exasperated look and seta package down on thetable. </span></p><p class="c30 c144"><span class="c0">&quot;I won&#39;t!&quot;Kirstisputtered. &quot;I won&#39;tever,</span><span class="c3">ever </span><span class="c0">wear them! Not if you chainmein a prison and beatme with sticks!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Annemarie giggled and looked questioningly at her mother. Mrs. Johansen sighed. &quot;I bought Kirstisome newshoes,&quot;sheexplained. &quot;She&#39;s outgrown her old ones.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Goodness, Kirsti,&quot;Ellen said, &quot;I wishmymother would get </span><span class="c3">me </span><span class="c0">some newshoes. I love newthings,and it&#39;s so hard to find themin thestores.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Not if you go to a</span><span class="c3">fish </span><span class="c0">store!&quot;Kirsti bellowed. &quot;Butmost mothers wouldn&#39;tmaketheir daughters wear ugly </span><span class="c3">fish </span><span class="c0">shoes!&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Kirsten,&quot;Mamasaid soothingly, &quot;you knowit wasn&#39;tafish store. And we werelucky to find shoesatall.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Kirstisniffed. &quot;Showthem,&quot;shecommanded. &quot;ShowAnnemarie and Ellen howugly they are.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Mama opened the packageand took outa pair oflittle girl&#39;s shoes. She held themup,and Kirstilooked away in disgust. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;You knowthere&#39;s no leatheranymore,&quot;Mamaexplained. &quot;But they&#39;vefound a way to makeshoes out offish skin. I don&#39;t think thesearetoo ugly.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Annemarieand Ellen looked at thefish skin shoes. Annemarie took onein her hand and examined it. It was odd-looking; thefish scales were visible. But it wasashoe,and her sister needed shoes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s notso bad, Kirsti,&quot;shesaid, lying alittle.</span></p><p class="c1 c177"><span class="c0">Ellen turned the other one over in her hand. &quot;You know,&quot;she said, &quot;it&#39;s only thecolor that&#39;s ugly.&quot; </span></p><p class="c135"><span class="c0">&quot;Green!&quot;Kirstiwailed. &quot;I will never,</span><span class="c3">ever </span><span class="c0">wear green shoes!&quot; </span></p><p class="c35 c42"><span class="c0">&quot;In ourapartment,&quot;Ellen told her, &quot;my father hasajar of black, black ink. Would you liketheseshoes better iftheywere black?&quot; </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c0">Kirstifrowned. &quot;MaybeI would,&quot;shesaid, finally. </span></p><p class="c100 c157"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, then,&quot;Ellen told her, &quot;tonight, if your mama doesn&#39;tmind, I&#39;lltaketheshoes homeand ask my father to makethemblack for you, with his ink.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c148"><span class="c0">Mamalaughed. &quot;I think that would beafineimprovement. What do you think, Kirsti?&quot; </span></p><p class="c17 c24"><span class="c0">Kirsti pondered. &quot;Could he makethemshiny?&quot;sheasked. &quot;I want themshiny.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c21"><span class="c0">Ellen nodded. &quot;I think hecould. I think they&#39;ll be quite pretty, black and shiny.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c139"><span class="c0">Kirsti nodded. &quot;Allright, then,&quot;shesaid. &quot;But youmustn&#39;t tell anyonethat they&#39;re</span><span class="c3">fish. </span><span class="c0">I don&#39;t wantanyoneto know.&quot;Shetook her newshoes, holding themdisdainfully,and put themon achair. Then shelooked with interestat the paper dolls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Can I play, too?&quot;Kirstiasked. &quot;Can I havea doll?&quot;She squatted beside Annemarieand Ellen on thefloor. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Sometimes, Annemariethought, Kirstiwas such a pest,always butting in. But theapartment was small. There was no other place for Kirstito play. And ifthey told her to go away, Mama would scold. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Here,&quot;Annemariesaid,and handed her sisteracut-out little girl doll. &quot;We&#39;re playing</span><span class="c3">Gone With the Wind. </span><span class="c0">Melanieand Scarlettare going to a ball. You can be Bonnie. She&#39;s Scarlett&#39;s daughter.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Kirsti danced her doll up and down happily. &quot;I&#39;mgoing to the ball!&quot;sheannounced in a high, pretend voice. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Ellen giggled. &quot;Alittle girlwouldn&#39;t go to a ball. Let&#39;s makethem go someplaceelse. Let&#39;s makethemgo to Tivoli!&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&quot;Tivoli!&quot;Annemarie began to laugh. &quot;That&#39;s inCopenhagen! </span><span class="c3">Gone With the Wind </span><span class="c0">is inAmerica!&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;Tivoli, Tivoli, Tivoli,&quot;little Kirstisang, twirling her dollin a circle. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&quot;It doesn&#39;tmatter, becauseit&#39;s only a gameanyway,&quot;Ellen pointed out. &quot;Tivolican be over there, by thatchair. &#39;Come, Scarlett,&#39;&quot;shesaid, using her doll voice, &quot;&#39;weshall go to Tivolito danceand watch thefireworks,and maybethere will besome handsome men there! Bring your silly daughter Bonnie,and shecan</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">ride on thecarousel.&#39;&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Annemarie grinned and walked her Scarlett toward thechair that Ellen had designated as Tivoli. Sheloved TivoliGardens, in the heart ofCopenhagen; her parents had taken her there, often, when she wasalittle girl. Sheremembered the musicand the brightly colored lights, thecarouseland icecreamand especially the magnificent fireworks in theevenings:the hugecolored splashesand bursts oflights in theevening sky. </span></p><p class="c82"><span class="c0">&quot;I remember thefireworks best ofall,&quot;shecommented to Ellen. &quot;Metoo,&quot;Kirstisaid. &quot;I remember thefireworks.&quot; </span></p><p class="c106"><span class="c0">&quot;Silly,&quot;Annemariescoffed. &quot;You never sawthefireworks.&quot; TivoliGardens wasclosed now. The German occupation forces had burned part ofit, perhapsasa way of punishing thefun-loving Danes for their lighthearted pleasures. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Kirsti drewherself up, her smallshoulders stiff. &quot;I did too,&quot;she said belligerently. &quot;It was my birthday. I woke up in the nightand I could hear the booms. And there werelights in thesky. Mamasaid it was fireworks for my birthday!&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">ThenAnnemarieremembered. Kirsti&#39;s birthdaywas latein August. And that night, only a month before, she, too, had been awakened and frightened by thesound ofexplosions. Kirstiwas right&mdash;thesky in thesoutheast had been ablaze,and Mama had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">comforted her by calling ita birthday celebration. &quot;Imagine, such fireworks foralittle girlfive years old!&quot;Mama had said, sitting on their bed, holding the dark curtain asideto look through the windowat thelighted sky. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The nextevening&#39;s newspaper had told thesad truth. The Danes had destroyed their own navalfleet, blowing up the vessels one by one,as the Germansapproached to take over theships for their own use. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Howsad the kingmust be,&quot;Annemarie had heard Mamasay to Papa when they read the news. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Howproud,&quot;Papa had replied. </span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c0">It had made Annemariefeelsad and proud, too, to picturethe tall,aging king, perhaps with tears in his blueeyes,as helooked at theremains of his small navy, which nowlay submerged and brokenin the harbor. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t want to play anymore, Ellen,&quot;shesaid suddenly,and put her paper doll on thetable. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;I haveto go home,anyway,&quot;Ellen said. &quot;I haveto help Mama with the housecleaning. Thursday is our NewYear. Did you know that?&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Why is it yours?&quot;asked Kirsti. &quot;Isn&#39;t it our NewYear, too?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No. It&#39;s theJewishNewYear. That&#39;s just for us. But if you want, Kirsti, you can comethat nightand watchMamalight the candles.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemarieand Kirsti had often been invited to watchMrs. Rosen light the Sabbath candles on Friday evenings, Shecovered her head with acloth and said aspecial prayer inHebrewas she </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c0">did so. Annemariealways stood very quietly,awed, to watch;even Kirsti, usually such achatterbox, wasalways stillat that time. They didn&#39;t understand the words or the meaning, but they could feel whataspecialtimeit was for the Rosens. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes,&quot;Kirstiagreed happily. &quot;I&#39;llcomeand watch your mama light thecandles,and i&#39;llwear my newblack shoes,&quot; </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c0">But this time was to be different. Leaving for school onThursdaywith her sister, Annemariesawthe Rosens walking to the synagogueearly in the morning, dressed in their bestclothes. She waved to Ellen, who waved happily back. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;LuckyEllen,&quot;Annemariesaid to Kirsti. &quot;She doesn&#39;t haveto go to schooltoday.&quot; </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">&quot;Butshe probably has to sit very, very still, like we do in church,&quot;Kirsti pointed out. &quot;</span><span class="c3">That&#39;s </span><span class="c0">no fun.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thatafternoon, Mrs. Rosen knocked at their door but didn&#39;t comeinside. Instead, shespokeforalong timein a hurried, tense voiceto Annemarie&#39;s mother in the hall. WhenMamareturned, her face was worried, but her voice wascheerful. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Girls,&quot;shesaid, &quot;we havea nicesurprise. Tonight Ellenwill be coming to stay overnightand to be our guest forafewdays! It isn&#39;t oftenwe havea visitor.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kirsticlapped her hands in delight. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;But, Mama,&quot;Annemariesaid, in dismay, &quot;it&#39;s their NewYear. Theywere going to haveacelebration at home! Ellen told methat her mother managed to getachicken someplace,and she was goingto roast it&mdash;their first roastchicken in a year or more!&quot; </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">&quot;Their plans havechanged,&quot;Mamasaid briskly. &quot;Mr.and Mrs. Rosen have been called away to visitsomerelatives. So Ellenwill staywith us. Now, let&#39;s get busy and putclean sheets on your bed. Kirsti, youmay sleep withMamaand Papatonight,and we&#39;lllet the big girls giggletogether by themselves.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Kirsti pouted,and it wasclear thatshe wasabout to argue. &quot;Mama willtell you aspecialstory tonight,&quot;her mother said. &quot;One just for you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Abouta king?&quot;Kirstiasked dubiously. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Abouta kin, if ouwish,&quot;Mamareplied.</span></p><p class="c120"><span class="c0">&quot;Allright, then. But there must bea queen, too,&quot;Kirstisaid. </span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c0">ThoughMrs. Rosen had sent herchicken to theJohansens,and Mama madealovely dinner largeenough for second helpingsall around, it was notan evening oflaughterand talk. Ellenwas silentat dinner. Shelooked frightened. Mamaand Papatried to speak of cheerfulthings, but it wasclear that theywere worried,and itmade Annemarie worry, too. OnlyKirstiwas unaware ofthe quiet tensionin theroom. Swinging her feet in their newly blackened and shiny shoes, shechattered and giggled during dinner. </span></p><p class="c32 c95"><span class="c0">&quot;Early bedtimetonight, little one,&quot;Mamaannounced after the dishes were washed. &quot;We need extratimefor thelong story I promised,about the king and queen.&quot;She disappeared withKirsti into the bedroom. </span></p><p class="c5 c193"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;Annemarieasked when sheand Ellenwere alone with Papain theliving room. &quot;Something&#39;s wrong. What is it?&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c196"><span class="c0">Papa&#39;s face was troubled. &quot;I wish that Icould protect you children fromthis knowledge,&quot;hesaid quietly. &quot;Ellen, you already know. Nowwe must tellAnnemarie.&quot; </span></p><p class="c30 c218"><span class="c0">Heturned to herand stroked her hair with his gentle hand. &quot;This morninat thesnaoue therabbitold hisconreation that the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nazis havetaken thesynagoguelists ofalltheJews. Wherethey live, what their namesare. Ofcoursethe Rosens were on that list, alongwithmany others.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Why? Why did theywant those names?&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;They plan to arrestallthe Danish Jews. They plan to takethem away. And we have been told that theymay cometonight.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t understand! Takethemwhere?&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Her father shook his head. &quot;We don&#39;t knowwhere,and we don&#39;t really knowwhy. They callit &#39;relocation.&#39; We don&#39;teven knowwhat thatmeans. We only knowthat it is wrong,and it is dangerous,and we must help.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemarie was stunned. Shelooked at Ellen and sawthat her best friend wascrying silently. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Whereare Ellen&#39;s parents? We must help them, too!&quot; </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">&quot;Wecouldn&#39;t takeallthree ofthem. Ifthe Germanscameto search ourapartment, it would beclear that the Rosens were here. One personwecan hide. Not three. So Peter has helped Ellen&#39;s parents to go elsewhere. We don&#39;t knowwhere. Ellen doesn&#39;t knoweither. But they aresafe.&quot; </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">Ellen sobbed aloud,and put her facein her hands. Papa put his armaround her. &quot;They aresafe, Ellen. I promise you that. Youwill</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seethemagain quitesoon. Can you try hard to believe my promise?&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ellen hesitated, nodded,and wiped hereyes with her hand. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;But, Papa,&quot;Annemariesaid, looking around thesmall apartment, with its fewpieces offurniture:thefatstuffed sofa, the tableand chairs, thesmall bookcaseagainst the wall. &quot;You said that we would hide her. Howcanwe do that? Wherecan she hide?&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Papasmiled. &quot;That part iseasy. It will beas your mamasaid: you two willsleep together in your bed,and youmay giggleand talkand tellsecrets to each other. And ifanyonecomes&mdash;&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Ellen interrupted him. &quot;Who mightcome? Willit besoldiers? Likethe ones on thecorners?&quot;Annemarieremembered how terrified Ellen had looked the daywhen thesoldier had questioned themon thecorner. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;I really don&#39;t think anyone will. But it never hurts to be prepared. Ifanyoneshould come,even soldiers, you two will be sisters. You aretogether so much, it will beeasy for you to pretend that you aresisters.&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">Heroseand walked to the window. He pulled thelacecurtain asideand looked down into thestreet. Outside, it was beginning to growdark. Soon theywould haveto drawthe black curtains thatall Danes had on their windows; theentirecity had to becompletely</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">darkened at night. In a nearby tree,a bird was singing; otherwiseit was quiet. It was thelast night ofSeptember. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Go, now,and get into your nightgowns. It will bealong night.&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Annemarieand Ellen got to their feet. Papasuddenly crossed the roomand put hisarmsaround themboth. He kissed thetop ofeach head:Annemarie&#39;s blond one, which reached to his shoulder,and Ellen&#39;s dark hair, thethick curls braided asalways into pigtails. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t befrightened,&quot;hesaid to themsoftly. &quot;OnceI had three daughters. Tonight Iamproud to havethree daughtersagain.&quot;</span></p><p class="c186"><span class="c23">5. Who Is the Dark-Haired One? </span></p><p class="c28 c50"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you really think anyone willcome?&quot;Ellen asked nervously, turning to Annemariein the bedroom. &quot;Your father doesn&#39;t think so.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c108"><span class="c0">&quot;Ofcourse not. They&#39;realways threatening stuff. They just liketoscare people.&quot;Annemarietook her nightgown froma hook in the closet. </span></p><p class="c6 c155"><span class="c0">&quot;Anyway, ifthey did, it would give meachanceto practice acting. I&#39;d just pretend to be Lise. I wish I weretaller, though.&quot;Ellenstood on tiptoe, trying to make herselftall. Shelaughed at herself, and her voice was morerelaxed. </span></p><p class="c6 c67"><span class="c0">&quot;Youwere greatas the Dark Queen in theschool play last year,&quot;Annemarietold her. &quot;You should bean actress when you growup.&quot; </span></p><p class="c153 c216"><span class="c0">&quot;My father wants meto beateacher. [ Ic wants</span><span class="c3">everyone</span><span class="c0">to be ateacher, like him. ButmaybeIcould convince himthat I should go to acting school.&quot;Ellen stood on tiptoeagain,and madean imperious gesture with herarm. &quot;Iamthe Dark Queen,&quot;sheintoned dramatically. &quot;I havecometo command the night!&quot; </span></p><p class="c30 c45"><span class="c0">&quot;You should try saying, &#39;IamLiseJohansen!&#39;&quot;Annemariesaid, grinning. &quot;If you told the Nazis that youwerethe Dark Queen, they&#39;d haul you offto a mentalinstitution.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c38"><span class="c0">Ellen dropped heractress poseand sat down, with her legs curled under her, on the bed. &quot;Theywon&#39;t really come here, do you think?&quot;sheasked again. </span></p><p class="c6 c104"><span class="c0">Annemarieshook her head. &quot;Not in a million years.&quot;She picked up her hairbrush. </span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c0">The girls found themselves whispering as they got ready for bed. There was no need, really, to whisper; theywere,afterall, supposed to be normalsisters,and Papa had said they could giggle and talk. The bedroomdoor wasclosed. </span></p><p class="c6 c121"><span class="c0">But the night did seem, somehow, different froma normal night. And so theywhispered. </span></p><p class="c32 c204"><span class="c0">&quot;Howdid your sister die, Annemarie?&quot;Ellen asked suddenly. &quot;I remember when it happened. And I remember thefuneral&mdash;it was the only timeI haveever been in a Lutheran church. But I never knewjust what happened.&quot; </span></p><p class="c17 c100"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know</span><span class="c3">exactly,&quot; </span><span class="c0">Annemarieconfessed. &quot;Sheand Peter were outsomewheretogether,and then there wasatelephonecall, that there had been an accident. Mamaand Paparushed to the hospital&mdash;remember, your mothercameand stayed withmeand Kirsti? Kirstiwasalready asleep and sheslept right through everything, she was so littlethen. But I stayed up,and I was with your mother in theliving roomwhenmy parentscame homein the</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">middle ofthe night. And they told me Lise had died.&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;I remember it was raining,&quot;Ellen said sadly. &quot;It was stillraining the nextmorningwhenMamatold me. Mama wascrying,and the rainmadeitseemas ifthe whole </span><span class="c3">world </span><span class="c0">wascrying.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemariefinished brushing her long hairand handed her hairbrush to her best friend. Ellen undid her braids, lifted her dark hairaway fromthethin gold chain she worearound her neck&mdash;the chain that held the Star ofDavid&mdash;and began to brush her thick curls. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;I think it was partly because oftherain. They said she was hit by acar. I supposethestreets wereslippery,and it was getting dark,and maybethe driver justcouldn&#39;tsee,&quot;Annemarie went on, remembering. &quot;Papalooked so angry. He made one hand into afist, and he kept pounding it into the other hand. I remember the noise of it:slam, slam, slam.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Together they got into the wide bed and pulled up thecovers. Annemarie blewout thecandleand drewthe dark curtainsasideso that the openwindownear the bed let in someair. &quot;Seethat blue trunk in thecorner?&quot;shesaid, pointing through the darkness. &quot;Lots ofLise&#39;s thingsarein there. Even her wedding dress. Mamaand Papa have never looked at thosethings, notsincethe day they packed themaway.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ellen sighed. &quot;She would havelooked so beautifulin her</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wedding dress. She had such a pretty smile. I used to pretend that she was </span><span class="c3">my</span><span class="c0">sister, too.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;She would haveliked that,&quot;Annemarietold her. &quot;Sheloved you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s the worst thing in the world,&quot;Ellenwhispered. &quot;To be dead so young. I wouldn&#39;t want the Germans to take my family away&mdash;to make us livesomeplaceelse. Butstill, it wouldn&#39;t beas bad as being dead.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemarieleaned overand hugged her. &quot;Theywon&#39;t take you away,&quot;shesaid. &quot;Not your parents,either. Papa promised that they weresafe,and healways keeps his promises. And you are quite safe, here with us.&quot; </span></p><p class="c88"><span class="c0">Fora whilethey continued to murmur in the dark, but the murmurs wereinterrupted by yawns. ThenEllen&#39;s voicestopped, sheturned over,and in a minute her breathingwas quietand slow. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">Annemariestared at the windowwheretheskywas outlined andatree branchmoved slightly in the breeze. Everything seemed very familiar, very comforting. Dangers were no morethan odd imaginings, like ghoststories thatchildrenmade up to frighten one another:things thatcouldn&#39;t possibly happen. Annemariefelt completely safe herein her own home, with her parents in the next roomand her best friend asleep beside her. She yawned contentedly and closed hereyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c98"><span class="c0">It was hours later, butstill dark, when she wasawakened abruptly by the pounding on theapartment door. </span></p><p class="c66"><span class="c0">Annemarieeased the bedroomdoor open quietly, only acrack, and peeked out. Behind her, Ellenwas sitting up, hereyes wide. </span></p><p class="c202"><span class="c0">Shecould see Mamaand Papain their nightclothes, moving about. Mama held alighted candle, butas Annemarie watched, she went to alamp and switched it on. It was so long atimesincethey </span></p><p class="c78 c83"><span class="c0">had dared to usethestrictly rationed electricity after dark that the light in theroomseemed startling to Annemarie, watching through theslightly opened bedroomdoor. Shesawher mother look automatically to the blackoutcurtains, making certain that theywere tightly drawn. </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c0">Papa opened thefront door to thesoldiers. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">&quot;This is theJohansen apartment?&quot;Adeep voiceasked the question loudly, in theterribly accented Danish. </span></p><p class="c5 c40"><span class="c0">&quot;Our nameis on the door,and I see you haveaflashlight,&quot;Papa answered. &quot;What do youwant?Is somethingwrong?&quot; </span></p><p class="c30 c181"><span class="c0">&quot;I understand you areafriend of your neighbors the Rosens, Mrs. Johansen,&quot;thesoldier said angrily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;SophyRosen is my friend, that is true,&quot;Mamasaid quietly. &quot;Please,could you speak moresoftly?&quot;My children areasleep.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Then youwill beso kind as to tellme wherethe Rosensare.&quot; He made no effort to lower his voice. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Iassumethey areat home, sleeping. It is four in the morning, afterall,&quot;Mamasaid. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemarie heard thesoldier stalk across theliving roomtoward the kitchen. Fromher hiding placein the narrowsliver of open doorway, shecould seethe heavy uniformed man,a holstered pistol at his waist, in theentranceto the kitchen, peering in toward the sink. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Another German voicesaid, &quot;The Rosens&#39; apartment isempty. Weare wondering iftheymight be visiting their good friends the Johansens.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;Well,&quot;said Papa, moving slightly so that he was standing in front ofAnnemarie&#39;s bedroomdoor,and shecould see nothing except the dark blur of his back, &quot;as you see, you are mistaken. Thereis no one here butmy family.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;Youwill not object ifwelook around.&quot;The voice was harsh, and it was nota question. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Itseems we have no choice,&quot;Papareplied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Please don&#39;t wake my children,&quot;Mamarequested again. &quot;There is no need to frighten little ones.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The heavy, booted feetmoved across theflooragain and into the other bedroom. Acloset door opened and closed with a bang. </span></p><p class="c86"><span class="c0">Annemarieeased her bedroomdoorclosed silently. She stumbled through the darkness to the bed. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ellen,&quot;she whispered urgently, &quot;take your necklace off!&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Ellen&#39;s hands flewto her neck. Desperately she began trying to unhook thetiny clasp. Outsidethe bedroomdoor, the harsh voices and heavy footstepscontinued. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Ican&#39;t get it open!&quot;Ellen said frantically. &quot;I never takeit off&mdash;I can&#39;teven remember howto open it!&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Annemarie heard a voicejust outsidethe door. &quot;What is here?&quot; </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">&quot;Shhh,&quot;her mother replied. &quot;My daughters&#39; bedroom. They are sound asleep.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&quot;Hold still,&quot;Annemariecommanded. &quot;This will hurt.&quot;She grabbed thelittle gold chain, yanked with all her strength,and broke it. As the door opened and light flooded into the bedroom, she crumpled it into her hand and closed her fingers tightly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Terrified, both girls looked up at thethree Nazi officers who</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">entered theroom. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">One ofthe men aimed aflashlightaround the bedroom. He went to theclosetand looked inside. Thenwith asweep of his gloved hand he pushed to thefloor severalcoatsand a bathrobethat hung frompegs on the wall. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">There was nothing elsein theroomexceptachest of drawers, the blue decorated trunk in thecorner,and a heap ofKirsti&#39;s dolls piled in asmallrocking chair. Theflashlight beamtouched each thing in turn. Angrily the officer turned toward the bed. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Get up!&quot;he ordered. &quot;Come out here!&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Trembling, thetwo girls rosefromthe bed and followed him, brushing past thetwo remaining officers in the doorway, to thelivingroom. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">Annemarielooked around. Thesethree uniformed menwere different fromthe ones on thestreetcorners. Thestreetsoldiers were often young, sometimes illatease,and Annemarie remembered howthe Giraffe had, fora moment, let his harsh pose slip and had smiled at Kirsti. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But these menwere olderand their faces wereset with anger. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Her parents werestanding besideeach other, their faces tense, but Kirstiwas nowherein sight. Thank goodness that Kirstislept through almosteverything. Ifthey had wakened her, she would be</span></p><p class="c164"><span class="c0">wailing&mdash;or worse, she would beangry,and her fists would fly. &quot;Your names?&quot;the officer barked. </span></p><p class="c81"><span class="c0">&quot;AnnemarieJohansen. And this is my sister&mdash;&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;Quiet! Let her speak for herself. Your name?&quot;He was glaring at Ellen. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Ellen swallowed. &quot;Lise,&quot;shesaid,and cleared her throat. &quot;Lise Johansen.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The officer stared at themgrimly. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;Now,&quot;Mamasaid in astrong voice, &quot;you haveseen that weare not hiding anything. Maymy children go back to bed?&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The officer ignored her. Suddenly he grabbed a handful of Ellen&#39;s hair. Ellenwinced. </span></p><p class="c109"><span class="c0">Helaughed scornfully. &quot;You havea blond child sleeping in the other room. And you havethis blond daughter&mdash;&quot;He gestured toward Annemarie with his head. &quot;Where did you get the dark haired one?&quot;Hetwisted thelock ofEllen&#39;s hair. &quot;Froma different father? Fromthe milkman? </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">Papastepped forward. &quot;Don&#39;tspeak to mywifein such a way. Let go ofmy daughter or I willreport you for such treatment.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Or maybe you got her someplaceelse?&quot;the officercontinued with asneer. &quot;Fromthe Rosens?&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Fora moment no onespoke. ThenAnnemarie, watching in panic, sawher father moveswiftly to thesmall bookcaseand take outa book. Shesawthat he was holding thefamily photograph album. Very quickly hesearched through its pages, found what he was looking for,and tore out three pictures fromthreeseparate pages. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">He handed themto the German officer, who released Ellen&#39;s hair. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Youwillseeeach ofmy daughters,eachwith her name written on the photograph,&quot;Papasaid. </span></p><p class="c88"><span class="c0">Annemarie knewinstantlywhich photographs he had chosen. Thealbumhad many snapshots&mdash;allthe poorly focused pictures of schooleventsand birthday parties. But italso contained a portrait, </span></p><p class="c85"><span class="c0">taken by a photographer, ofeach girlasatiny infant. Mama had written, in her delicate handwriting, the name ofeach baby daughter across the bottomofthose photogrpahs. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Sherealized too, with an icy feeling, why Papa had torn them fromthe book. At the bottomofeach page, belowthe photograph itself, was written the date. And therealLiseJohansen had been born twenty-one yearsearlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;KirstenElisabeth,&quot;the officer read, looking at Kirsti&#39;s baby picture. Helet the photograph fallto thefloor. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Annemarie,&quot;heread next, glanced at her,and dropped the second photograph. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Lise Margrete,&quot;heread finally,and stared at Ellen foralong, unwaveringmoment. In her mind, Annemarie pictured the photograph that he held:the baby, wide-eyed, propped againsta pillow, her tiny hand holding asilver teething ring, her barefeet visible belowthe hemofan embroidered dress. The wispy curls. Dark. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The officer torethe photograph in halfand dropped the pieces on thefloor. Then heturned, the heels of his shiny boots grinding into the pictures,and left theapartment. Withouta word, the other two officers followed. Papastepped forward and closed the door behind him. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Annemarierelaxed theclenched fingers of her right hand, which stillclutched Ellen&#39;s necklace. Shelooked down,and sawthatshe had imprinted the Star ofDavid into her palm.</span></p><p class="c152"><span class="c23">6. Is the Weather Good for Fishing? </span></p><p class="c167"><span class="c0">&quot;We must think what to do,&quot;Papasaid. &quot;They aresuspicious, now. To be honest, I thought that ifthey came hereatail&mdash;and I hoped theywouldn&#39;t&mdash;that theywould just glancearound, seethat we had no placeto hideanyone,and would go away.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c20"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;msorry I have dark hair,&quot;Ellenmurmured. &quot;Itmadethem suspicious.&quot; </span></p><p class="c32 c65"><span class="c0">Mamareached over quickly and took Ellen&#39;s hand. &quot;You have beautiful hair, Ellen, just like your mama&#39;s,&quot;shesaid. &quot;Don&#39;tever be sorry for that. Weren&#39;t welucky that Papathoughtso quickly and found the pictures? And weren&#39;t welucky that Lise had dark hair when she wasa baby?It turned blond later on, when she was two or so.&quot; </span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">&quot;In between,&quot;Papaadded, &quot;she was bald fora while!&quot; </span></p><p class="c26 c188"><span class="c0">Ellen and Annemarie both smiled tentatively. Fora moment their fear waseased. </span></p><p class="c182"><span class="c0">Tonight was thefirst time, Annemarierealized suddenly, that Mamaand Papa had spoken ofLise. Thefirst timein three years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Outside, theskywas beginning to lighten. Mrs. Johansenwent to the kitchen and began to maketea. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ve never been up so early before,&quot;Annemariesaid. &quot;Ellen and I will probably fallasleep in schooltoday!&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Paparubbed hischin fora moment, thinking. &quot;I think we must not taketherisk ofsending you to schooltoday,&quot;hesaid. &quot;It is possiblethat theywilllook for theJewish children in theschools.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Not go to school?&quot;Ellen asked in amazement. &quot;My parents havealways told methateducation is the most important thing. Whatever happens, I must getan education.&quot; </span></p><p class="c221"><span class="c0">&quot;This will only bea vacation, Ellen. For now, your safety is the most important thing. I&#39;msure your parents would agree. Inge?&quot; Papacalled Mamain the kitchen,and shecameto the doorway with ateacup in her hand and a questioning look on her face. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes?&quot; </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">&quot;We must takethe girls to Henrik&#39;s. You remember what Peter told us. I think today is the day to go to your brother&#39;s.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Mrs. Johansen nodded. &quot;I think you areright. But I willtake them. Youmuststay here.&quot; </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">&quot;Stay hereand let you go alone? Ofcourse not. I wouldn&#39;tsend you on a dangerous trip alone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c190"><span class="c0">Mama puta hand on Papa&#39;sarm. &quot;If only I go with the girls, it will besafer. They are unlikely to suspecta woman and her children. But ifthey are watching us&mdash;ifthey seeall of us leave?If they areawarethat theapartment isempty, that you don&#39;t go to your officethis morning? Then theywill know. Then it will be dangerous. Iamnotafraid to go alone.&quot; </span></p><p class="c115"><span class="c0">It was very seldomthat Mama disagreed with Papa. Annemarie watched his faceand knewthat he was strugglingwith the decision. Finally he nodded, reluctantly. </span></p><p class="c82 c173"><span class="c0">&quot;I will pack somethings,&quot;Mamasaid. &quot;What timeis it?&quot; Papalooked at his watch. &quot;Almost five,&quot;hesaid. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">&quot;Henrik willstill bethere. Heleavesaround five. Why don&#39;t you call him?&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c210"><span class="c0">Papa went to thetelephone. Ellen looked puzzled. &quot;Who is Henrik? Where does he go at fivein the morning?&quot;sheasked. </span></p><p class="c5 c29"><span class="c0">Annemarielaughed. &quot;He&#39;s my uncle&mdash;mymother&#39;s brother. And he&#39;safisherman. They leave very early,allthefishermen,each morning&mdash;their boats go outatsunrise. </span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, Ellen,&quot;she went on. &quot;Youwillloveit there. It is where my grandparents lived, where Mamaand Uncle Henrik grewup. It is so beautiful&mdash;right on the water. You can stand at theedge ofthe</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">meadowand look across to Sweden!&quot; </span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c0">Shelistened while Papaspoke on thetelephoneto Uncle Henrik, telling himthat Mamaand thechildrenwerecoming fora visit. Ellen had goneinto the bathroomand closed the door; Mama was stillin the kitchen. So onlyAnnemarie was listening. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasa very puzzling conversation. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;So, Henrik, is the weather good for fishing?&quot;Papaasked cheerfully,and listened briefly. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Then hecontinued, &quot;I&#39;msending Ingeto you todaywith the children,and she will be bringing you acarton ofcigarettes. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, just one,&quot;hesaid,aftera moment. Annemariecouldn&#39;t hear Uncle Henrik&#39;s words. &quot;But therearealot ofcigarettes availableinCopenhagen now, if you knowwhereto look,&quot;he went on, &quot;and so there will be otherscoming to you as well, I&#39;msure.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">But it wasn&#39;t true. Annemarie was quitecertain it wasn&#39;t true. Cigarettes werethething that Papa missed, the wayMama missed coffee. Hecomplained often&mdash;he had complained only yesterday&mdash;that there were no cigarettes in thestores. The men in his office, he </span></p><p class="c85"><span class="c0">said, making aface, smoked almostanything:sometimes dried weeds rolled in paper,and thesmellwas terrible. </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">Whywas Papaspeaking that way,almostas if he werespeakingin code? What was Mama</span><span class="c3">really</span><span class="c0">taking to Uncle Henrik?</span></p><p class="c222"><span class="c0">Then she knew. It was Ellen. </span></p><p class="c136"><span class="c0">*** </span></p><p class="c35 c51"><span class="c0">Thetrain ride north along the Danish coast was very beautiful. Again and again they could seetheseafromthe windows. Annemarie had madethis trip often to visit her grandparents when theywerealive,and later,after theywere gone, to secthecheerful, suntanned, unmarried uncle whomsheloved. </span></p><p class="c137"><span class="c0">But thetrip was newto Ellen, who sat with her face pressed to the window, watching thelovely homesalong theseaside, thesmall farmsand villages. </span></p><p class="c6 c163"><span class="c0">&quot;Look!&quot;Annemarieexclaimed,and pointed to the oppositeside. &quot;It&#39;s Klampenborg,and the Deer Park! Oh, I wishwecould stop here, just foralittle while!&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c125"><span class="c0">Mamashook her head. &quot;Not today,&quot;shesaid. Thetrain did stop at thesmallKlampenborg station, but none ofthefewpassengers got off. &quot;Have you ever been there, Ellen?&quot;Mamaasked, but Ellen said no. </span></p><p class="c5 c199"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, someday youwill go. Someday youwillwalk through the park and youwillsee hundreds of deer, tameand free.&quot; </span></p><p class="c30 c172"><span class="c0">Kirstiwriggled to her kneesand peered through the window. &quot;I don&#39;tseeany deer!&quot;shecomplained.</span></p><p class="c1 c118"><span class="c0">&quot;They arethere, I&#39;msure,&quot;Mamatold her. &quot;They&#39;re hiding in the trees.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c140"><span class="c0">Thetrain started again. The doorat theend oftheircar opened and two German soldiersappeared. Annemarietensed. Not here, on thetrain, too? Theywere</span><span class="c3">everywhere. </span></p><p class="c6 c212"><span class="c0">Together thesoldiers strolled through thecar, glancing at passengers, stopping hereand thereto ask a question. One ofthemhad something stuck in his teeth; he probed with his tongueand distorted his own face. Annemarie watched with a kind of frightened fascination as the pairapproached. </span></p><p class="c6 c58"><span class="c0">One ofthesoldiers looked downwith a bored expression on his face. &quot;Whereare you going?&quot;heasked. </span></p><p class="c6 c75"><span class="c0">&quot;Gilleleje,&quot;Mamareplied calmly. &quot;My brother lives there. We are going to visit him.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c187"><span class="c0">Thesoldier turned away and Annemarierelaxed. Then, without warning, heturned back. &quot;Are you visiting your brother for the NewYear?&quot;heasked suddenly. </span></p><p class="c5 c31"><span class="c0">Mamastared at himwith a puzzled look. &quot;NewYear?&quot;she asked. &quot;It is onlyOctober.&quot; </span></p><p class="c30 c79"><span class="c0">&quot;And guess what!&quot;Kirstiexclaimed suddenly, in aloud voice, looking at thesoldier.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">Annemarie&#39;s heartsank and shelooked at her mother. Mama&#39;s eyes werefrightened. &quot;Shhh, Kirsti,&quot;Mamasaid. &quot;Don&#39;tchatter so.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c203"><span class="c0">But Kirsti paid no attention to Mama,as usual. Shelooked cheerfully at thesoldier,and Annemarie knewwhatshe wasabout to say:This is our friend Ellen and it&#39;s </span><span class="c3">her </span><span class="c0">NewYear! </span></p><p class="c6 c196"><span class="c0">Butshe didn&#39;t. Instead, Kirsti pointed at her feet. &quot;I&#39;mgoing to visitmyUncle Henrik,&quot;shechirped, &quot;and I&#39;mwearingmy brand newshiny black shoes!&quot; </span></p><p class="c147"><span class="c0">Thesoldierchuckled and moved on. </span></p><p class="c35 c146"><span class="c0">Annemarie gazed through the windowagain. Thetrees, the Baltic Sea,and thecloudyOctober sky passed in a bluras they continued north along thecoast. </span></p><p class="c19 c28"><span class="c0">&quot;Smelltheair,&quot;Mamasaid when they stepped offthetrain and madetheir way to the narrowstreet, &quot;Isn&#39;t it lovely and fresh?It always brings back memories for me.&quot; </span></p><p class="c17 c176"><span class="c0">Theair was breezy and cool,and carried thesharp, not unpleasantsmell ofsaltand fish. High against the paleclouds, seagulls soared and cried outas iftheywere mourning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mamalooked at her watch. &quot;I wonder ifHenrik will be back yet. But it doesn&#39;tmatter. The houseisalways unlocked. Come on, girls, we&#39;llwalk. It isn&#39;t far, justalittle under two miles. And it&#39;sa nicc day. We&#39;lltakethe path through the woods instead ofthetoad. It&#39;salittlelonger, but it&#39;s so pretty,&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Didn&#39;t you lovethecastle whenwe went throughHelsing&oslash;r, Ellen?&quot;Kirstiasked. She had been talking about KronborgCastle ever sincethey had seen it, sprawlingmassiveand ancient, beside </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c0">thesea, fromthetrain. &quot;I wishwecould havestopped to visit the castle. Kings livethere. And queens.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemariesighed in exasperationwith her littlesister. &quot;They do not,&quot;shesaid. &quot;They did in the old days. But therearen&#39;tany kings there now. Denmark only </span><span class="c3">has </span><span class="c0">one king,anyway. And helives in Copenhagen.&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">But Kirsti had pranced away, skipping along thesidewalk. &quot;Kingsand queens,&quot;shesang happily. &quot;Kingsand queens.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Mamashrugged and smiled. &quot;Let her dream, Annemarie. I did thesame when I was herage.&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">Sheturned, leading the way along atiny, twisting street, heading toward the outskirts ofthe village. &quot;Things have hardly changed here sinceI wasa girl,&quot;shesaid. &quot;MyAunt Gittelived there, in that house&quot;&mdash;she pointed&mdash;&quot;and she&#39;s been dead for years. But the houseis thesame. Shealways had wonderfulflowers in her</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">garden.&quot;She peered over thelowstone walland looked at thefew flowering bushesas they passed the house. &quot;Maybethey still do, but it&#39;s the wrong time of year&mdash;therearejust thosefew chrysanthemums left. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;And see, over there?&quot;She pointed again. &quot;My best friend&mdash;her name was Helena&mdash;lived in that house. Sometimes I used to spend the night with her. Butmore often shecameto my house, on weekends. It was morefun to bein thecountry. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;My brother Henrik always teased us, though,&quot;shecontinued with achuckle. &quot;Hetold us ghoststoriesand scared us halfto death.&quot; </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c0">Thesidewalk ended and Mamaturned onto a dirt path borderedby trees. &quot;When I walked eachmorning into town for school,&quot;she said, &quot;my dog followed methis far. At theend ofthe path heturned and went back home. I guess he wasacountry dog and didn&#39;t like town. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&quot;And do you knowwhat?&quot;she went on, smiling. &quot;I had named himTrofast&mdash;Faithful. And it was just theright namefor him, because whatafaithful dog he was! Every afternoon he wasalways right here, waiting for meto return. He knewtheright time, somehow. Sometimes,as Icomearound this bend,even today, I feelas ifI mightcome uponTrofast, waiting still, with his tail wagging.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the pathwasempty today. No people. No faithful dogs. Mamashifted the bag she wascarrying fromone hand to the other, and theywalked on through the woods untilthe path opened to a meadowdotted with cows. Herethe path skirted theedge ofthe field,along afence,and beyond it they could seethe gray sea, ruffled bywind. The breeze moved the high grass. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">At theend ofthe pasture, they entered the woodsagain and Annemarie knewtheywould soon bethere. Uncle Henrik&#39;s house was in aclearing beyond these woods. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Do youmind ifI run ahead?&quot;sheasked suddenly. &quot;I want to be thefirst to seethe house!&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;Go on,&quot;Mamatold her. &quot;Run ahead and tellthe house we&#39;ve come home.&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">Then she put herarmaround Ellen&#39;s shouldersand added, &quot;Say that we&#39;ve broughtafriend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c61"><span class="c23">7. The House by the Sea </span></p><p class="c50 c166"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, Annemarie,&quot;Ellen said, with awein her voice, &quot;it is beautiful,&quot; </span></p><p class="c72"><span class="c0">Annemarielooked around and nodded her head in agreement. The houseand the meadows thatsurrounded it wereso much a part of herchildhood,a part of her life, thatshe didn&#39;t often look at them</span></p><p class="c46"><span class="c0">with fresh eyes. But nowshe did, seeingEllen&#39;s pleasure. And it was true. Theywere beautiful. </span></p><p class="c168"><span class="c0">Thelittlered-roofed farmhouse was very old, itschimney crooked and even thesmall, shuttered windows tilted atangles. A bird&#39;s nest, wispywith straw, was half hidden in thecorner where theroofmet the wallabovea bedroomwindow. Nearby,a gnarled tree was stillspeckled with afewapples nowlong past ripe. </span></p><p class="c5 c15"><span class="c0">Mamaand Kirsti had goneinside, but Annemarieand Ellen ran across the high-grassed meadow, through thelate wildflowers. Fromnowhere,a gray kitten appeared and ran besidethem, pouncing hereand there upon imagined mice, pausing to lick its paws,and then darting offagain. It pretended to ignorethe girls, but looked back often to becertain that theywerestillthere,apparently pleased to have playmates. </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">The meadowended at thesea,and the graywater licked there at dam brown rass flattened b the wind and bordered b</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">smooth heavy stones. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;I have never been thiscloseto thesea,&quot;Ellen said. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;Ofcourse you have. You&#39;ve been to the harbor inCopenhagen a million times.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Ellen laughed. &quot;I mean the</span><span class="c3">real</span><span class="c0">sea, the way it is here. Open like this&mdash;a whole world ofwater.&quot; </span></p><p class="c53"><span class="c0">Annemarieshook her head in amazement. To liveinDenmark,a country surrounded bywater,and never to havestood at itsedge? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Your parentsarereally city people,aren&#39;t they?&quot; </span></p><p class="c151"><span class="c0">Ellen nodded. &quot;Mymother isafraid ofthe ocean,&quot;shesaid, laughing. &quot;Shesays it is too big for her. And too cold!&quot; </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">The girls sat on arock and took offtheir shoesand socks. They tiptoed across the damp stonesand let the water touch their feet. It </span><span class="c3">was</span><span class="c0">cold. They giggled and stepped back. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Annemarieleaned down and picked up a brown leafthat floated back and forthwith the movement ofthe water. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&quot;Look,&quot;shesaid. &quot;This leafmay havecomefromatreein Sweden. Itcould have blown fromatreeinto thesea,and floated allthe way across. See over there?&quot;shesaid, pointing. &quot;Secthe land? Way across there? That&#39;s Sweden.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c200"><span class="c0">Ellen cupped one hand over hereyesand looked across the waterat the misty shorelinethat wasanothercountry. &quot;It&#39;s notso very far,&quot;shesaid. </span></p><p class="c6 c80"><span class="c0">&quot;Maybe,&quot;Annemariesuggested, &quot;standing over therearetwo girls just ourage, looking acrossand saying, &#39;That&#39;s Denmark!&#39;&quot; </span></p><p class="c71"><span class="c0">They squinted into the hazy distance,as iftheymightsee Swedish children standing thereand looking back. But it was too far. They sawonly the hazy strip ofland and two small boats bobbing up and down in the gray ruffles ofseparatingwater. </span></p><p class="c6 c156"><span class="c0">&quot;I wonder if one ofthoseis your Uncle Henrik&#39;s boat,&quot;Ellen said. </span></p><p class="c6 c99"><span class="c0">&quot;Maybe. Ican&#39;t tell. They&#39;retoo faraway. Uncle Henrik&#39;s boat is named the</span><span class="c3">Ingeborg</span><span class="c0">,&quot;shetold Ellen, &quot;for Mama.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c69"><span class="c0">Ellen looked around. &quot;Does he keep it right here? Does hetieit up so that it won&#39;t floataway?&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c123"><span class="c0">Annemarielaughed. &quot;Oh, no. In town,at the harbor, there&#39;sa big dock,and allthefishing boats go and comefromthere. That&#39;s wherethey unload their fish. You should smellit! At night they are allthere,anchored in the harbor.&quot; </span></p><p class="c171"><span class="c0">&quot;Annemarie! Ellen!&quot;Mama&#39;s voicecameacross the meadow. The girls looked around,and sawher waving to them. They turned,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">picked up their shoes,and beganwalking toward the house. The kitten, who had settled comfortably on thestony shore, rose immediately and followed them. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;I took Ellen down to showher thesea,&quot;Annemarieexplained when they reached the place where Mama waited. &quot;She&#39;d never been thatclose before! Westarted to wade, but it was too cold. I wishwe had comein summer so wecould swim.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;scold even then,&quot;Mamasaid. Shelooked around. &quot;You didn&#39;tseeanyone, did you? You didn&#39;t talk to anyone?&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Annemarieshook her head. &quot;Just the kitten.&quot;Ellen had picked it up,and it lay purring in herarmsas shestroked its small head and talked to itsoftly. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;I meant to warn you. Youmuststay away frompeople while weare here.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;But there&#39;s no onearound here,&quot;Annemariereminded her. </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">&quot;Even so. If you seeanyoneatall&mdash;even someone you know, one ofHenrik&#39;s friends&mdash;it is better if you comein the house. It is too difficult&mdash;maybeeven dangerous&mdash;to explainwho Ellen is.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Ellen looked up and bit her lip. &quot;Therearen&#39;tsoldiers here, too?&quot; sheasked. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mamasighed. &quot;I&#39;mafraid therearesoldierseverywhere. And</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">especially now. This isa bad time. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">&quot;Comein nowand help mefix supper. Henrik will be home soon. Watch thestep there; it&#39;s loose. Do you knowwhat I have done?I found enough apples forapplesauce. Even though thereis </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c0">no sugar, theapplesaresweet. Henrik will bring homesomefish and thereis wood for thefire, so tonight we will be warmand well fed.&quot; </span></p><p class="c86"><span class="c0">&quot;It is nota bad time, then,&quot;Annemarietold her. &quot;Not ifthereis applesauce.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Ellen kissed the kitten&#39;s head and let it leap fromherarms to the ground. It darted away and disappeared in thetall grass. They followed Mamainto the house. </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">That night, the girls dressed for bed in thesmall upstairs bedroomtheyweresharing, thesame bedroomthat had been Mama&#39;s when she wasalittle girl. Across the hall, Kirstiwas already asleep in the wide bed that had once belonged to Annemarie&#39;s grandparents. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Ellen touched her neck after she had put onAnnemarie&#39;s flower sprigged nightgown, whichMama had packed. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Whereis my necklace?&quot;sheasked. &quot;What did you do with it?&quot; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&quot;I hid it in asafe place,&quot;Annemarietold her. &quot;Avery secret place where no one willever find it. And I will keep it therefor you</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">untilit is safefor you to wear itagain.&quot; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Ellen nodded. &quot;Papa gaveit to me when I was very small,&quot;she explained. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Shesat down on theedge ofthe old bed and ran her fingers along the handmade quilt thatcovered it. Theflowersand birds, faded now, had been stitched onto the quilt byAnnemarie&#39;s great grandmother many years before. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;I wish I knewwhere my parentsare,&quot;Ellen said in asmall voice as she outlined one oftheappliqued birds with her finger. </span></p><p class="c88"><span class="c0">Annemarie didn&#39;t havean answer for her. She patted Ellen&#39;s hand and they sat together silently. Through the window, they could secathin, round slice ofmoon appear through theclouds,against the palesky. The Scandinavian night was not very dark yet, though soon, whenwintercame, the night would be not only dark but very long, nightskies beginning in thelateafternoon and lasting through morning. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">Fromdownstairs, they could hear Mama&#39;s voice,and Uncle Henrik&#39;s, talking,catching up on news. Mama missed her brother when she hadn&#39;tseen himfora while, Annemarie knew. Theywere very close. Mamaalways teased himgently for notmarrying;she asked him, laughing, when theyweretogether, whether he had found a good wife yet, one who would keep his housetidier. Henrikteased back,and told Mamathatsheshould cometo Gillelejeto</span></p></div>
